// Modified for implementation for RemoteVCC
//! Manages connection establishement messages between a RemoteVCC router and a webrtcsink.
//!
//! This progives a Signaller which manages the WebSocket connections and communication between
//! a RemoteVCC router and a webrtcsink gstreamer node within a gsreamer pipeline. It is designed
//! to be extended as a g_object and managed by gstreamer across threads and is therefore built to
//! be thread safe when given Send and Sync traits.
//!
//! This will also spawn its own thread to hold open a WebSocket connection to the RemoteVCC
//! router to listen for proxied client connection messgages.
//!
//! It is the webrtcsink gstreamer node itself that creates and connectes the WebRTC
//! connections with the clients after sufficient connection establishment messages bave been
//! funneled through the Signaller. The messaging required is typical of WebRTC connection
//! establishment messaging and follows the RemoteVCC router messaging protocol.
//!
//! If the WebSocket connection to the RemoteVCC router is lost, this will wait a short
//! moment before attempting a reconnection, while maintaining any already established WebRTC
//! based Peer-to-Peer connections with a client. Connections that were still in the process
//! of being connected could resume connection, but are unlikely to if the RemoteVCC router
//! was restarted, and could end up being a small memory leak.
